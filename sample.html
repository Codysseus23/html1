            <p>I am originally from Sweet Home Alabama. Specifically the Madison/Huntsville area near the Space and Rocket Center. 
                <br>My dad got me interested in tech very early in my life but I didn't consider a career in it for a while.
                
                <br>After High School, I went to the University of Alabama, despite being an Auburn fan, because they offered a full ride in the field I was interested in, Management Information Systems.
                
                <br>I ended up not completing college and moved back home for a couple of years until I met my now fiance and moved to GA for her.
                
                <br>I then actually found out about this class from a friend I play Magic with and he suggested I look into the boot camp and I am glad I did for many reasons.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>It got me out of a rut I had been stuck in.</li>
                    <li>It gave me confidence to work towards a better me and a career I am interested in.</li>
                    <li>The bootcamp style seemed right up my alley for how I learn.</li>

                </ul>
                </ul>

            <p>I am excited for the journey ahead becasue this cohort has been nothing short of <b>wondrous</b>! 
            <br>I can't tell you how much y'all have helped me. Once again, thank you so much to the teachers and fellow students.

            <li>My first love will forever and always be music!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For those curious, the band "God is an Astronaut" is my favorite.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>My second love is Video Games, whether they be a hack 'n slash or a movie on rails, I love them all, because they are art.</li>
