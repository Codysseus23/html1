<h1>This exercise is about making lists.</h1>

<h2>Here's what I like about lists:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying list of stuff.</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another lost item here because doing things in threes is cool.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you make a list, do it in this order:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not.</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag.</li>
       <ul>
            <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Curveball! Yuo can nest lists inside each other.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        
            
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
</ol>
